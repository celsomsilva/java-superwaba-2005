# Sales - Java Mobile Project (2005)

> **Note:** This repository contains the original version in Portuguese (file names, variables and methods).  You will find the repository that contains the English-translated version here: [java SuperWaba 2005 en](https://github.com/celsomsilva/java-mobile-2005-en.


This is a legacy project developed in 2005 using **Java** and the **SuperWaba** SDK — a mobile development platform derived from the **Waba project**, an early pioneer in mobile Java development (before Java ME).

This commercial application, `Sales`, was built for mobile devices running **Palm OS** (eg: Zire, Tungsten, Sony Clie) and **Windows CE** platforms.

## About SuperWaba

The SuperWaba company — led by **Guilherme Campos Hazan** — continued the original Waba Project, which began in 1999, and was later incubated at the **Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio)**.

SuperWaba SDK initially supporting Palm OS devices and later expanding to Windows CE and other platforms via SDL from version 5.0. It was a popular option for enterprise mobile applications throughout the early 2000s. SuperWaba was officially adopted in large-scale projects in Brazil.

> **Note:** SuperWaba was later renamed and evolved into [TotalCross](https://github.com/TotalCross/totalcross), a modern, lightweight mobile SDK offering improved performance and broader cross-platform support.

---

## About This Project

The Sales application and examples included in the SuperWaba package were developed in 2005 by me while working at SuperWaba.

The goal was to create a portable, lightweight, and efficient mobile sales force management system for handheld devices used by sales teams in the field.

**Main functionalities:**
- Client management  
- Product catalog management  
- Price table handling  
- Order entry and tracking  
- Sales reporting and dashboards

## Project Structure


> At that time, Java packages typically followed simple directory-based naming (e.g., `db/`, `ui/`, `custumer/`)  
> instead of domain-based structures (`br.com.project...`).  
> This reflects the early pre-Eclipse Java era.

## Institutional Use

SuperWaba was officially adopted in large-scale projects in Brazil, including government-led initiatives. Notably:

In **2009**, the **Brazilian Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management**, through the **IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics)**, issued an official tender for the **migration of the Censo 2010 mobile application from SuperWaba to TotalCross**.

**Official Tender Highlights:**
- **Tender:** Pregão Eletrônico Nº 76/2009  
- **Service:** Migration of Censo2010 mobile application from SuperWaba to TotalCross  
- **Included Deliverables:**
  - Full code review and optimization for TotalCross
  - Workshop to train a 15-person internal IBGE team on TotalCross technology and source code updates
  - Licensing of **260,000 virtual machines** for a one-year period
